# React Server

This app contains all of the endpoints needed for the entire React Curriculum.

For example:

- https://github.com/gSchool/react-crm

## NOTE

This server stores everything in-memory, so every time you restart the server, you get a clean slate.

## Install

```
yarn
yarn start
```

Then you can see the API running on http://localhost:8181

## API Endpoints

### Messages

`GET /api/messages`
